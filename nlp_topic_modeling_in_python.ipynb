    "\n",
    "Shout out to Hui for teaching me that this could be used for topic modeling!  We are going to keep things very simple but I want to provide just a superficial explanation of the logic of this technique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) seems like an intimidating technique but the basic logic is very simple. You may remember from elementary school that factorization is breaking a number down into numbers that when multiplied together equal the initial value (e.g., 30 = (2X3)X5 ).  We can do something similiar with matrices.  However, matrix multiplication has a special requirement that the number of rows in one matrix (we'll call is matrix W) must equal the number of columns in the other matrix (matrix H).  Because there are many different values that the number of rows/number of columns can take on we have to select a value for factorization.  Matrix multiplication follows slighty different rules from traditional multiplication which you can read about here.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we can multiply a simple factorization back together to get the original value (e.g., (2x3)x5 = 30), we can multiply Matrix W X Matrix H to reconstruct our original Document X Term matrix.  However, our reconstructed matrix is unlikely to exactly match our original matrix and the degree to which the values differ tells us how well our proposed model fits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing!  *Non-negative Matrix Factorization is exactly that - non-negative*.  No value in the matrix can be below zero.  This makes it a good fit for behavioral data (you can't have negative clicks) but a poor fit for things like financial data where there may be negative values.  "
