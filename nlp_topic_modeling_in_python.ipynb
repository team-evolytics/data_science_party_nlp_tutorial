    "Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive Python environment for data science.   Cells are seperated into Markdown (i.e., text) and code cells.  In this notebook, you should not need to edit code (unless you really want to!). Therefore, you can just run each cell by highlighting it and pressing \"Cmd + Return\" or using the \"> Run\" key at the top.\n",

    "# 3.  Model Creation:  Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shout out to Hui for teaching me that this could be used for topic modeling!  We are going to keep things very simple but I want to provide just a superficial explanation of the logic of this technique.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) seems like an intimidating technique but the basic logic is very simple. You may remember from elementary school that factorization is breaking a number down into numbers that when multiplied together equal the initial value (e.g., 30 = (2X3)X5 ).  We can do something similiar with matrices.  However, matrix multiplication has a special requirement that the number of rows in one matrix (we'll call is matrix W) must equal the number of columns in the other matrix (matrix H).  Because there are many different values that the number of rows/number of columns can take on we have to select a value for factorization.  Matrix multiplication follows slighty different rules from traditional multiplication which you can read about here.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we can multiply a simple factorization back together to get the original value (e.g., (2x3)x5 = 30), we can multiply Matrix W X Matrix H to reconstruct our original Document X Term matrix.  However, our reconstructed matrix is unlikely to exactly match our original matrix and the degree to which the values differ tells us how well our proposed model fits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing!  *Non-negative Matrix Factorization is exactly that - non-negative*.  No value in the matrix can be below zero.  This makes it a good fit for behavioral data (you can't have negative clicks) but a poor fit for things like financial data where there may be negative values.  "

apostolic christian denomination of catholicism to evangelical protestantism and founded bernal christian records in order to evangelize his protestant christian beliefs through his la nuevo cristiana ministry bernal currently owns and operates more than a dozen spanish language religious radio stations located in texas carrying a satellitefed programming schedule in 2008 paulino bernal released a new cd of polkas produced by grammywinning producer armando lichtenberger jr el maestro del acordeon y sus polkas on urbana records and received his first grammy nomination for best polka album for the 51st annual grammyschicanos mexicanamericans have always been prolific music makers they have been the music trendsetters among mexicans in the southwest throughout most of the 20th century in fact beginning in the 1930s the texasmexicans created the two most powerful regional styles ever to emerge among mexicans anywhere orquesta and conjuntothe best of the conjuntos is beyond a doubt el conjunto bernal described by connoisseurs of conjunto music as the only one of its kind and twenty years ahead of its time el conjunto bernal is well known for its tremendous range of innovations its musical experiments spanned the gamut of conjunto from the traditional polka to latin music such as the bolero cha cha cha and even american rock and roll el conjunto bernal owed much of its originality and meteoric rise to fame to the genius of its founder paulino bernalpaulino bernal was born june 22 1939 in raymondville texas reared in the grinding poverty that was experienced by most chicanos of his generation paulino was forced to give up schooling when he was in the seventh grade an accomplished accordionist by that time he left school to try and earn money and get us out of the poverty in which we found ourselvesbernals mother was a divorcee and early on she moved to kingsville texas where paulino his older brother eloy the younger luis and three sisters were all forced to pick cotton cucumbers and other crops to help support the family one day a man came by the house selling a guitar and mrs bernal with great sacrifice bought it for the boys paulino soon learned enough to play the cantinas with an elderly accordionist where he picked up tips to help buy food for the bernal familybut paulinos future lay with the accordion he remembers hearing the best accordionists of the late 1940s and early 1950s on the radio narciso martinez valerio longoria tony de la rosa all of whom were recording for the largest mexicanamerican company at the time ideal records paulino dreamed of joining their ranks and when a friend of his was given an accordion as a gift it was paulino who spent the most time practising on it shortly afterwards during a trip to visit his father in rio grande valley eloy was given a bajo sexto by him and the bernals were soon ontrack toward their futurelos hermanitos bernal launched their musical career in 1952 they were hired to play a dance in nearby premont paulino on accordion eloy on bajo sexto and a friend adan lomas on drums according to bernal a lot of people attended and they liked the bernal brothers so much they kept calling us back they began playing in falfurrias and in alice nearby the home of ideal records soon the bernal brothers came to the attention of armando marroquin the man who recorded all the artists for ideal recordsthe bernal brothers were first recorded as the backup conjunto for some of the duets then popular among texasmexicans such as carmen y laura in march 1955 marroquin gave the bernals their chance as headliners and a 78 rpm record was released with the cancion ranchera mujer paseada on one side and the romantic bolero desprecio on the other with the release of their first record the bernal brothers quickly put their cotton picking days behind them forever and soon joined valerio longoria and tony de la rosa as the top conjuntos in texasel conjunto bernal recorded prolifically for ideal between 1955 and 1960 and some of the best sides including the monster hits mi unico camino and sentimiento y renco both from late 1958 are on this cd and cassettemarroquin began taking them on tours throughout the southwest and beyond where they always played for packed houses they were especially popular in arizona where local bandleader pedro bugarin was fond of featuring them with his orchestra in fact according to paulino he and eloy used to sit in with bugarins band and some of the band musicians would in turn sit in with el conjunto bernal this exposure to band music inspired paulino to branch out of the normally simple ranchera music of the conjunto into the more sophisticated style of the orquestawhen armando marroquin ended his relationship with ideal records around 1960 el conjunto bernal stayed with him and recorded for his new label nopal records shortly thereafter conjunto bernal relocated to mcallen texas across the border from mexico in the lower rio grande valley bernal began working with victor gonzales and the two men founded bego records the company name a combination of their two last names the bego years represent some of conjunto bernals most innovative work it was at his time that paulino attracted the most talented musicians in the conjunto traditions to his groupin the late 1960s gonzales bought out paulinos interest in bego records and paulino went on to found bernal records which also produced many outstanding hits by el conjunto bernal by this time however paulino had given up performing in favor of the administrative aspects of show business he ran the recording company hosted a regional tv music show and generally concentrated on the promotional aspects of the business meanwhile oscar hernandez and other very able accordionists picked up the slack and carried on the tradition of excellence begun by paulino during this same time success in the music field took its toll on paulino and he succumbed to the allure of alcohol and drugsin 1972 however a cook paulino had hired to work in a restaurant he owned changed his life by converting him to the teachings of bornagain christianity from that day on paulino gave up the life of alcohol and drugs to devote himself to preaching he also resumed his career as accordionist only this time he did so in the service of christianity he started a new recording company bernal christian records under whose banner he has continued to develop his inimitable style as he once commented in an interview people who knew me before lament that im not playing anymore they dont seem to realize that i play more now than i ever did before \n",
